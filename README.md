# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project aims to predict medical insurance charges based on demographic and health-related features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. We apply linear regression and perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: insurance.csv
- Features: age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, charges

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Project Steps
1. Load and analyze dataset
2. Visualize data and detect patterns
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Train linear regression model
5. Evaluate model performance

## 📈 Output
The trained model predicts insurance charges based on input features with decent accuracy. The main influence was from smoking status, age, and BMI.

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Add more models (RandomForest, XGBoost)
- Tune hyperparameters
- Handle outliers
